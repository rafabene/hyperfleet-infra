# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/).
This repository does not follow traditional semantic versioning — Terraform modules are versioned
via git tags, Helm charts are versioned in their component repositories, and infrastructure changes
are deployed directly from `main`. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md#release-process) for details.
